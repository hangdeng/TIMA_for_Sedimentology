## Welcome to the GitHub page for [Mineralogy Analysis with TIMA](https://hangdeng.github.io/TIMA_for_Sedimentology/)

TIMA stands for TESCAN Integrated Mineral Analyzer (TIMA), a revolutionary instrument used for minerals and materials analysis. Because software designed for processing raw data from TIMA is not specifically designed for data analysis in sedimentology/stratigraphy, this repository is created in order to guide data processing, data analysis with TIMA for sedimentology/stratigraphy. The TIMA used in collecting data is from [Automated Minerology Laboratory](https://geology.mines.edu/laboratories/automated-mineralogy-laboratory/).

### 1 Introduction

#### 1.1 Minerals and mineral groups

The TESCAN software requires an understanding of rock-forming minerals and their groups (correctly group minerals into brackets before starting data collection).

Rock-forming Minerals: The common rock-forming minerals include quartz, feldspars, pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas, clays, olivine, calcite, and dolomite. [[1]](#1).

 </p>

Therefore, we put together information being used for grouping minerals. Mineral groups are arranged alphabetically.

- The **amphiboles** group: nephrite
- The **biotite mica** group: annite, phlogopite, siderophyllite, fluorophlogopite, fluorannite, eastonite, and many others.
- The **calcite** group: calcite, smithsonite, siderite, gaspeite, magnesite, otavite, rhodochrosite, sphaerocobaltite ([[2]](#2),[[3]](#3))
- The **olivine** group: forsterite, fayalte, monticellite, kirschsteinite, tephroite
- The **pyroxenes** group: augite, diopside, jadeite, and spodumene.
