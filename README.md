## Welcome to the GitHub page for [Mineralogy Analysis with TIMA](https://hangdeng.github.io/TIMA_for_Sedimentology/)

TIMA stands for TESCAN Integrated Mineral Analyzer (TIMA), a revolutionary instrument used for minerals and materials analysis. Because software designed for processing raw data from TIMA is not specifically designed for data analysis in sedimentology/stratigraphy, this repository is created in order to guide data processing, data analysis with TIMA for sedimentology/stratigraphy. The TIMA used in collecting data is from [Automated Minerology Laboratory](https://geology.mines.edu/laboratories/automated-mineralogy-laboratory/).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### 1 Introduction

The TESCAN software requires an understanding of rock-forming minerals and their groups before data collection.

Rock-forming Minerals: The common rock-forming minerals include quartz, feldspars, pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas, clays, olivine, calcite, and dolomite. [[1]](#1).

- The pyroxenes group: augite, diopside, jadeite, and spodumene.
- The amphiboles group: nephrite
- The olivine group: forsterite, fayalte, monticellite, kirschsteinite, tephroite
- The biotite mica group: annite, phlogopite, siderophyllite, fluorophlogopite, fluorannite, eastonite, and many others.
